```

## 5. Security Framework (Additional Consideration)

### Security Layers
1. Infrastructure Security
- Zero-trust architecture
- Multi-factor authentication
- Encryption at rest and in transit
- Regular security audits

2. Operational Security
```yaml
Requirements:
- SOC 2 Type II compliance
- GDPR compliance
- ISO 27001 certification
- Regular penetration testing
```

3. Data Security
```python
class DataSecurityFramework:
    def __init__(self):
        self.encryption = AES256Encryption()
        self.access_control = RBACController()
        self.audit_logger = SecurityAuditLogger()
```

## 6. Scalability Design (Additional Consideration)

### Horizontal Scaling
1. Component Scaling
```
Component          | Scale Unit  | Max Scale
-----------------------------------------
Control Plane     | 1000 nodes  | 100k nodes
Analytics Engine  | 500 req/s   | 50k req/s
Provider APIs     | 200 req/s   | 20k req/s
```

2. Data Scaling
```python
class ScalabilityManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.shard_manager = DatabaseSharding()
        self.cache_system = DistributedCache()
        self.load_balancer = AdaptiveLoadBalancer()
```

Supporting Code Example for Control System:

```python
class CloudControlSystem:
    def __init__(self):
        self.security = SecurityFramework()
        self.scaling = ScalabilityManager()
        self.metrics = MetricsCollector()
        
    async def manage_infrastructure(self):
        # Collect current state
        metrics = await self.metrics.gather()
        security_status = await self.security.audit()
        
        # Analyze and optimize
        optimization_plan = await self.generate_plan(
            metrics,
            security_status
        )
        
        # Execute with safety checks
        if self.validate_plan(optimization_plan):
            await self.execute_plan(optimization_plan)
            await self.verify_execution()
```
